/**
 * An avatar can be circular or a rounded rectangle, depending on usage. The
 * default is a rounded rectangle and requires `.slds-avatar` as the base class.
 * Use a circle for all people-oriented objects that could potentially render
 * as avatars. For a fully round avatar, add the `.slds-avatar--circle` class.
 * Four additional classes are available for sizing.

 * If an image is unavailable, up to two letters can be used instead. If the
 * record name contains two words, like first and last name, use the first
 * capitalized letter of each. For records that only have a single word name,
 * use the first two letters of that word using one capital and one lower case
 * letter. If either an image or initials are unavailable, use the object icon as a fallback.
 *
 * @summary An avatar component represents an object or entity
