/**
 * Breadcrumbs are typically constructed with an `ol` because their order
 * matters. You mark up breadcrumbs with classes from the horizontal list
 * utility. When you add the `.slds-breadcrumb` class, the separators are
 * automatically generated.
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Place the breadcrumb in a `nav` element with `role="navigation"`.
 * The `nav` element is also marked-up with `aria-label="Breadcrumbs"` to
 * describe the type of navigation.
 *
 * @summary Use breadcrumbs to note the path of a record and help the user to navigate back to the parent.
 *
 * @base
 * @name breadcrumbs
 * @selector .slds-breadcrumb
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category base
 * @type navigation
 * @role navigation
