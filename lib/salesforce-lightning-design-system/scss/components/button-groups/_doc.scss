/**
 * Buttons in a group are surrounded by a parent with the `.slds-button-group` class, unless they are in a list (in which case they use `.slds-button-group-list`. If the last button is an icon, like the down triangle, use the `.slds-button--icon-border-filled` class when accompanying a `.slds-button--neutral` group.
 *
 * If the last button in a group needs to be wrapped in another element (for example, a drop-down trigger), add the `.slds-button--last` class to the wrapper element to create proper spacing and borders.
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Unless you are using the list version, include the Aria role `role="group"` so that assistive technologies are alerted to the grouping.
 *
 * @summary Button groups are used to bunch together buttons with similar actions
 *
 * @name button-groups
 * @base
 * @selector .slds-button-group
 * @category base
 * @type action
 * @role button
 * @support dev-ready
