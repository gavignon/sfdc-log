/**
 * The ‘add button’ is similar to a checkbox in that it presents a user with a
 * binary choice for an item. However, the only action a user can take is to
 * add (or remove) an entity. When a user clicks the add button, the entity is
 * stored, similar to an ‘add to cart’ experience, until the user saves changes.
 *
 * The add button is useful for increasing clarity. Since the button only adds
 * or removes entities, the user knows the action they will prompt upon click.
 * The add button also provides a clear visual affordance (in SLDS, we use the
 * ‘+’ icon as an metaphor for ‘add’) and a large target to take this action.
 *
 * Use the add button if the component you’re building:
 * - Exists without other multi-select elements (i.e. checkboxes)
 * - Allows users to select multiple entities
 * - Semantically fits the add/remove model
 *
