/**
 * The docked composer relies heavily on utility classes to piece together the layout so please pay close attention to the markup and classes.
 *
 * The overflow menu for docked composer, `.slds-docked-composer--overflow`, displays when the number of docked composers exceeds the width of the viewport. The overflow pill displays with a number indicator for all hidden docked composers. A user can invoke a popover with all available docked composers and replace the furthest left docked composer with the one being selected.
 *
 * When a user clicks on the "pop out" icon in the `.slds-docked-composer__header`, a modal displays and contains the task that was currently in the docked composer.
 *
 * @summary Docked Composer is a persistent utility bar that allows a user to continually use the app to complete tasks or gather information while expanding/collapsing a composer window.
 *
 * @base
 * @name docked-composer
 * @selector .slds-docked-composer
 * @support dev-ready
