/**
 * You can style the HTML `<input>` element to align with the Salesforce brand
 * by using the `.slds-input` class on the `<input>` element.
 *
 * The `<input>` element includes support for all HTML5 types: `text`,
 * `password`, `datetime`, `datetime-local`, `date`, `month`, `time`, `week`,
 * `number`, `email`, `url`, `search`, `tel`, and `color`.
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Inputs with errors should have `aria-describedby` to insure that the
 * associated field level error message is read by assistive technology.
 * If the error message has an `id="my-error-message"`, then the input should
 * have `aria-describedby="my-error-message"`.
 *
 * If you're needing some type of field level help and if your tooltips are
 * available on hover, make sure theyâ€™re also available on keyboard focus. The
 * help icon needs to be associated to the tooltip so that when the user focuses
 * on the icon, assistive technology reads out the content of the tooltip. If
 * the tooltip has an `id="help"`, then the `<button>` containing the icon should
 * have `aria-describedby="help"`.
 *
 * @summary Text inputs are used for freeform data entry
 *
 * @base
 * @name input
 * @selector .slds-input
 * @support dev-ready
