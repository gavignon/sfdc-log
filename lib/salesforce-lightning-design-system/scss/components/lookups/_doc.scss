/**
 * **Note** — A lookup is a combobox component, please find implementation documentation under the
 * combobox component
 *
 * The lookup can parse through single or multi scoped datasets. The parsed
 * dataset can be filtered by single or multi option selects.
 *
 * You can find the lookup component throughout most data fields that allow
 * inline inputs. Most commonly used on **record home** and **object home**.
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Lookups allow the user to have dual keyboard focus: while focus in the input
 * search field, the user can type text into the field and simultaneously use
 * arrow keys to navigate up and down the results list. Use the appropriate **ARIA**
 * attributes in your markup in order to effectively communicate the relationship
 * between the input field and the results list to users of assistive technology.
 *
 * **Expected markup:**
 *
 * - Input field has attributes `role="combobox"`, `aria-autocomplete="list"`
 * - Input field has an `aria-expanded` attribute whose value is `false` when the results list is hidden, `true` when the results list is visible
 * - Input field has an `aria-activedescendant` attribute whose value is the id of the highlighted results list option, no value if nothing’s highlighted in the list
 * - Results list is an `<ul role="presentation">`, where each item is containing an `<a href="javascript:void(0);" role="option">`
 *
 * **Expected keyboard interactions:**
 *
 * - Character keys filter the list
 * - Up and down arrow keys cycle through the available options in the list and
 * update the input field’s `aria-activedescendant` value
 * - Enter key selects highlighted option and collapses the results list
 * - Escape key collapses the results list
 *
 * @summary Lookup is an autocomplete combobox that will search against a database object.
