/**
 * The unordered menu list with `[role="menu"]` should be contained in a `<div>`
 * with the class `.slds-dropdown`. The exception to this is the **Action
 * Overflow for Touch**, which not a dropdown menu.
 *
 * The target HTML element and dropdown need to be wrapped in the class `.slds-dropdown-trigger dropdown-trigger--click`.
 *
 * By default, dropdown menus do not display a nubbin (the little cute triangle
 * pointing at your target). If you want to apply one, you can add the class
 * that defines the nubbin position and `.slds-nubbin--top` to the `.slds-dropdown`
 * HTML element.
 *
 * <div class="site-text-heading--label">Accessibility</div>
 *
 * The main thing that distinguishes menus from other popover blocks is keyboard
 * navigation: elsewhere, users press the Tab key to navigate through actionable
 * items, but in a menu, users press the arrow keys to navigate.
 *
 * **Expected markup:**
 *
 * - Menu trigger is a focusable element (`<a>` or `<button>`) with `aria-haspopup="true"`
 * - Menu has `role="menu"` and an `aria-labelledby` attribute whose value is the id of the menu trigger
 * - Menu items have `role="menuitem"`, `role="menuitemcheckbox"`, or `role="menuitemradio"`
 *
 * **Expected keyboard interactions:**
 *
 * - Arrow keys cycle focus through menu items (you should use JS to disable focus for any disabled items)
 * - Tab key closes menu and moves focus to the next focusable element on the page
 * - Esc key closes menu and moves focus back to the menu trigger
 * - Any character key moves focus to the next menu item that starts with that character, if applicable
 *
 * @summary A Menu offers a list of actions or functions that a user can access.
 *
 * @base
 * @name menus
 * @selector .slds-dropdown-trigger
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category experience
 * @type navigation
 * @role menu
