/**
 * Radio buttons are shown in a group of two or more. The user can only select
 * one radio button at a time. You should use the same `name` attribute on all
 * radio buttons in the group. This ensures that if there is more than one
 * group in the form, each one stays associated with its own group.
 *
 * The ability to style radio buttons with CSS varies across browsers. To
 * ensure that radio buttons look the same everywhere, we use a custom DOM.
 * Pay close attention to the markup, because all elements must exist for the
 * styles to work.
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Groups of radio buttons should be marked up using the fieldset and legend
 * element. This helps someone using assistive technology to understand
 * the question they're answering with the group of radio buttons. The fieldset
 * is placed around the whole group and the legend contains the question.
 *
 * Custom radio buttons are created by applying the `.slds-radio` class to a
 * `<label>` element. To remain accessible to all user agents, place an
 * `<input>` with `type="radio"` inside the `<label>` element. The `<input>`
 * is then visually hidden, and the styling is placed on a span with the
 * `.slds-radio--faux` class. The styling of the span changes based on whether
 * the radio button is selected or focused by using a pseudo-element. A second
 * span with `.slds-form-element__label` contains the label text.
 *
 * When a radio group is required, the `<fieldset>` should receive the class
 * `.slds-is-required`. The `<legend>` should then get
 * `<abbr class="required" title="required">*</abbr>` added to the DOM for
 * visual indication that the radio group is required.
 *
 * @summary A select list that can have a single entry checked at any one time.
 *
 * @base
 * @name radio-group
 * @selector .slds-radio
 * @support dev-ready
 * @category base
 * @type data-entry
 * @role radiogroup
