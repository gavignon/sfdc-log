/**
 * At a high-level, the buttons in RTE are organized into four groupings:
 * “format text”, “format body”, “insert content”, and “clear formatting”.
 *
 * The “clear formatting” button always stays at the end of the buttons set,
 * regardless of which rich text editor variant is used. It should always stand by itself.
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Ensure that there is a single tab key stop for the button groups in the
 * toolbar, and that left and right arrows are used to navigate through each button.
 *
 * @summary The Rich Text Editor is a textarea with added capabilities for use in various publishers.
