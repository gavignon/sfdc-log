/**
 * Nubbins are indicators that inform the user of the direction of the content associated with the tooltip. A tooltip can accept the following nubbin position classes, `.slds-nubbin--left`, `.slds-nubbin--left-top`, `.slds-nubbin--left-bottom`, `.slds-nubbin--top-left`, `.slds-nubbin--top-right`, `.slds-nubbin--right-top`, `.slds-nubbin--right-bottom`, `.slds-nubbin--bottom-left`, `.slds-nubbin--bottom-right`.
 *
 * Learn more about how to use them at the [Nubbins documentation](/components/popovers/#flavor-nubbins).
 *
 * #### Accessibility
 *
 * Showing the tooltip on hover or on keyboard focus of a focusable element ensures that all users can access it, even if they arenâ€™t using a mouse. Examples of focusable elements include links, buttons, and inputs. Give the tooltip an ID and use that as the value of the `aria-describedby` attribute of the DOM element it describes. This helps users of assistive technology read the tooltip content.
 *
 * @summary A Tooltip is a small piece of contextual information about an element on the screen, which is displayed when a user hovers or focuses on the element it is describing. It is not focusable and cannot contain focusable content.
