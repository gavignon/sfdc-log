/**
 * In our framework, all headings (`h1`&ndash;`h6`)
 * are reset to the base (body text) size, with margins and padding reset
 * to zero. When building an enterprise application, the heading level may vary
 * depending on the context of the component or page. Using the correct
 * heading level is important for&nbsp;accessibility.
 *
 * The text helper classes help maintain visual hierarchy separately from
 * the structural markup hierarchy.
 *
 * @summary For consistent typography throughout the application, we created text helper classes for headings and body&nbsp;text.
