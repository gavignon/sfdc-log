/**
 * If problems occur when using truncation with elements that use flexbox, you might need to add the `.slds-has-flexi-truncate` class on the flexbox child node ( `.slds-col` or `.slds-col--padded` elements) that contains the truncated text.
 *
 * **Note:** There is an iOS bug that is triggered when you add a component from Visualforce into S1 using an iFrame. The truncated element does not recognize its width.
 *
 * @summary When applying truncation, place the full text in a title attribute so that itâ€™s accessible on&nbsp;hover.
 *
 * @utility
 * @name truncation
 * @selector [class*='truncate']
 * @support dev-ready
